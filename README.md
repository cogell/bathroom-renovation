# Bathroom Renovation Project

A comprehensive documentation project for renovating a bathroom with electric heated flooring and tile installation.

## Project Overview

This repository documents the complete process of removing laminate flooring and installing an electric floor heating system with tile in a bathroom. The documentation is organized to serve as both a planning tool and a reference guide throughout the renovation process.

## Current Design Direction (Based on Research)

### High-Level Product Selections
Based on extensive research, the project is converging on a **Schluter-based system** for maximum compatibility and DIY success:

#### Shower System
- **Shower Pan**: Schluter KERDI-SHOWER foam tray (pre-sloped, tile-ready)
- **Waterproofing**: KERDI membrane overlapping from walls onto pan
- **Corners**: KERDI-CORNER pieces for all inside/outside corners
- **Drain**: KERDI-DRAIN integrated system

#### Bathroom Floor System
- **Heating + Waterproofing**: DITRA-HEAT membrane (or DITRA-HEAT-PS peel-and-stick)
- **Heating Cables**: Schluter heating cables sized for room
- **Thermostat**: Schluter DITRA-HEAT-E-WiFi programmable thermostat
- **Subfloor**: 3/4" exterior plywood (universal substrate)

#### Waterproofing Integration
- **Wall-to-Floor**: KERDI-BAND (7.25" wide) at all perimeter transitions
- **Shower-to-Floor**: 2" minimum overlap between shower and floor membranes
- **Corners**: KERDI-CORNER at all floor corners
- **Penetrations**: KERDI-SEAL around toilet flange and other penetrations

#### Installation Materials
- **Thin-Set**: Schluter ALL-SET throughout (eliminates modified vs. unmodified confusion)
- **Grout**: Waterproof grout (Mapei Flexcolor CQ or similar)
- **Sealant**: 100% silicone at all changes of plane

#### Finish Materials
- **Flooring**: Traditional porcelain tile (pending final selection)
- **Shower Walls**: Tile to match or complement floor
- **Baseboards**: White oak with hard wax oil finish (Rubio Monocoat)
- **Baseboard Installation**: 1/8" gap from floor with silicone seal

### Why This System?
1. **Complete Compatibility**: All Schluter products designed to work together
2. **Waterproofing**: Multiple layers of protection (belt & suspenders approach)
3. **DIY-Friendly**: Extensive documentation and support available
4. **Proven System**: Industry-standard with long track record
5. **Single Warranty**: One manufacturer for core waterproofing/heating components

### Still To Be Determined
- [ ] Exact tile selection (size, color, pattern)
- [ ] Basement insulation details (impacts heating performance)
- [ ] Final measurements for shower pan size
- [ ] Specific DITRA-HEAT kit (standard vs. peel-and-stick)
- [ ] Grout color selection

## Open Questions & Site-Specific Decisions

### Shower Configuration
1. **Shower Curb Construction**
   - How to build up the existing curb to proper height?
   - Options: Mortar bed, stacked 2x4s with membrane, prefab curb kit
   - Need to maintain 2" minimum height above finished floor
   - Must integrate with KERDI-SHOWER pan and waterproofing

2. **Drain Location**
   - Does existing drain align with standard KERDI-SHOWER sizes?
   - Cost/complexity of moving drain if needed?
   - Can custom-size pan accommodate existing location?
   - Plumbing access from basement?

3. **Wall Retrofit Integration**
   - How much existing wall tile needs removal for waterproofing?
   - Can we preserve upper walls and just remove bottom 6"?
   - How to handle transition between old and new tile?

### Floor System Questions
4. **Subfloor Condition**
   - Current subfloor material and thickness?
   - Any rot, damage, or deflection issues?
   - Need for additional reinforcement from below?
   - Joist spacing and condition?

5. **Floor Height Transitions**
   - Total height buildup with DITRA-HEAT + tile?
   - Transition to hallway flooring?
   - Door clearance issues?
   - Need for threshold or reducer strip?

### Heating System Specifics
6. **Electrical Requirements**
   - Dedicated circuit available or needed?
   - GFCI protection location?
   - Thermostat placement (wall cavity available)?
   - Total wattage calculation for room size?

### Waterproofing Details
7. **Toilet Area**
   - Flange height after new floor installation?
   - Need flange extender or new flange?
   - KERDI-SEAL-PS or wax ring?
   - Waterproofing under/around toilet base?

8. **Vanity Integration**
   - Flooring under vanity or around it?
   - Waterproofing at vanity location?
   - Plumbing penetration sealing?

### Material & Method Decisions
9. **Thinset Application**
   - DITRA-HEAT standard (requiring thinset) vs. DITRA-HEAT-PS (peel & stick)?
   - Cost difference vs. labor savings?
   - Availability of products locally?

10. **Tile Layout**
   - Start point for tile layout?
   - How to handle odd bathroom shape (6x6 minus washer/dryer area)?
   - Accent tiles or borders?
   - Grout line width (1/8", 3/16", 1/4")?

### Next Steps to Answer These Questions
- **Site Assessment**: Remove existing flooring to inspect subfloor and drain location
- **Measurements**: Document exact room dimensions, drain position, and curb height
- **Electrical Evaluation**: Check panel capacity and available circuits
- **Product Research**: Visit local suppliers to check Schluter product availability
- **Professional Consults**: Consider plumber consultation for drain relocation if needed

## Project Goals

1. **Research Phase**: ðŸ”„ Understand electric floor heating systems, tile options, and installation best practices (nearly complete)
2. **Planning Phase**: Create detailed specifications and complete bill of materials
3. **Preparation Phase**: Order materials and prepare workspace
4. **Execution Phase**: Install heating system and tile following documented procedures
5. **Documentation Phase**: Record as-built conditions and lessons learned
