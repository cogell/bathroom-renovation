# Bathroom Renovation Project - CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
This is a bathroom renovation project focused on flooring replacement:
- **Primary Goal**: Remove existing laminate flooring and install electric heated flooring with tile
- **Documentation**: All project documentation will be published as a static website using GitHub Pages
- **Approach**: Research-driven, methodical planning with clear milestones

## Project Structure

### Documentation Folders
- `research/` - Background research on materials, methods, and best practices
- `specifications/` - Detailed specifications for materials and equipment
- `bom/` - Bill of Materials with pricing and suppliers
- `guides/` - Step-by-step installation guides and milestones
- `assets/` - Images, diagrams, and supporting files

### Key Deliverables
1. **Research Documentation**: Compiled findings on electric floor heating systems, tile types, installation methods, and building codes
2. **Bill of Materials**: Complete list of all materials needed with quantities, sources, and costs
3. **Project Specifications**: Technical specifications for floor heating system, tiles, underlayment, and other components
4. **Installation Guide**: Detailed step-by-step guide with milestones and checkpoints

## GitHub Pages Configuration
- This project uses standard Markdown without Jekyll
- All `.md` files will be rendered as static HTML by GitHub Pages
- Keep all documentation in Markdown format
- Use relative links between documents
- Images should be stored in `assets/images/`

## Working Instructions

### When Creating Documentation
1. Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `electric-floor-heating-research.md`)
2. Include a table of contents for longer documents
3. Cross-reference related documents using relative links
4. Include sources and references for research
5. Use consistent formatting and structure

### Research Guidelines
- Document all findings with sources and dates
- Compare multiple products/methods when applicable
- Note local building codes and requirements
- Include cost estimates where relevant

### Bill of Materials Format
- Include item name, specifications, quantity, unit cost, total cost, and supplier
- Group items by category (flooring, heating, tools, consumables)
- Keep running total and add contingency buffer

### Step-by-Step Guide Format
- Break work into clear phases/milestones
- Include time estimates for each step
- Note required tools and materials for each phase
- Include safety considerations
- Add quality checkpoints

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Research
- Research electric floor heating systems
- Research tile options and installation methods
- Review building codes and permit requirements
- Create initial BOM

### Phase 2: Design & Specifications
- Finalize floor heating system specifications
- Select tiles and layout pattern
- Finalize complete BOM
- Create installation timeline

### Phase 3: Preparation
- Order all materials
- Prepare workspace
- Gather all tools
- Remove existing flooring

### Phase 4: Installation
- Install subfloor/underlayment
- Install electric heating system
- Install tile
- Apply grout and sealant

### Phase 5: Completion
- Final inspection
- Testing and commissioning
- Cleanup
- Documentation of as-built conditions

## Notes
- Always prioritize safety and code compliance
- Document decisions and changes as the project progresses
- Take photos at each major milestone
- Keep all receipts and warranty information
