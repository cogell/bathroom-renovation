# Bathroom Renovation Project - CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
This is a bathroom renovation project focused on flooring replacement:
- **Primary Goal**: Remove existing laminate flooring and install electric heated flooring with tile
- **Installation Approach**: 100% DIY (Do-It-Yourself) - All work will be performed by the homeowner
- **Documentation**: All project documentation will be published as a static website using GitHub Pages
- **Approach**: Research-driven, methodical planning with clear milestones and beginner-friendly instructions

## Project Structure

### Documentation Folders
- `research/` - Background research on materials, methods, and best practices
- `specifications/` - Detailed specifications for materials and equipment
- `bom/` - Bill of Materials with pricing and suppliers
- `guides/` - Step-by-step installation guides and milestones
- `assets/` - Images, diagrams, and supporting files

### Key Deliverables
1. **Research Documentation**: Compiled findings on electric floor heating systems, tile types, installation methods, and building codes
2. **Bill of Materials**: Complete list of all materials needed with quantities, sources, and costs
3. **Project Specifications**: Technical specifications for floor heating system, tiles, underlayment, and other components
4. **Installation Guide**: Detailed step-by-step guide with milestones and checkpoints

## GitHub Pages Configuration
- This project uses standard Markdown without Jekyll
- All `.md` files will be rendered as static HTML by GitHub Pages
- Keep all documentation in Markdown format
- Use relative links between documents
- Images should be stored in `assets/images/`

## Working Instructions

### When Creating Documentation
1. Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `electric-floor-heating-research.md`)
2. **Include summaries at the top of every document**:
   - **TL;DR**: A 3-second summary (one sentence)
   - **Summary**: A 30-second summary as concise bullet points (3-5 key points)
3. Almost always provide a table of contents
4. Cross-reference related documents using relative links
5. Include sources and references for research
6. Use consistent formatting and structure

### Research Guidelines
- Document all findings with sources and dates
- Compare multiple products/methods when applicable
- Note local building codes and requirements
- Include cost estimates where relevant
- **Focus on DIY-friendly information**: Include beginner tips, common mistakes, skill requirements
- **Highlight learning resources**: Link to installation videos, tutorials, and manufacturer guides
- **Safety first**: Always include safety considerations and when to call a professional
- **Tool requirements**: Note whether tools can be rented vs. purchased

### Bill of Materials Format
- Include item name, specifications, quantity, unit cost, total cost, and supplier
- Group items by category (flooring, heating, tools, consumables)
- Keep running total and add contingency buffer
- **Labor Cost Tracking**:
  - ALWAYS include professional installation labor costs in a SEPARATE column
  - Labor costs are for reference only (to show DIY savings)
  - NEVER include labor costs in the project total
  - Calculate total DIY savings by comparing material-only costs vs. professional installation quotes
- **Tool Costs**: Separate one-time tool purchases from consumables
- Note which tools can be rented vs. purchased

### Step-by-Step Guide Format
- Break work into clear phases/milestones
- Include time estimates for each step (realistic for DIY beginner)
- Note required tools and materials for each phase
- Include safety considerations and PPE requirements
- Add quality checkpoints and "how to verify" instructions
- **Beginner-Friendly Details**:
  - Explain "why" for each step, not just "how"
  - Include common mistakes and how to avoid them
  - Link to video tutorials where helpful
  - Note difficulty level for each phase
  - Suggest break points (good stopping places)
  - Include troubleshooting tips

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Research
- Research electric floor heating systems
- Research tile options and installation methods
- Review building codes and permit requirements
- Create initial BOM

### Phase 2: Design & Specifications
- Finalize floor heating system specifications
- Select tiles and layout pattern
- Finalize complete BOM
- Create installation timeline

### Phase 3: Preparation
- Order all materials
- Prepare workspace
- Gather all tools
- Remove existing flooring

### Phase 4: Installation
- Install subfloor/underlayment
- Install electric heating system
- Install tile
- Apply grout and sealant

### Phase 5: Completion
- Final inspection
- Testing and commissioning
- Cleanup
- Documentation of as-built conditions

## Notes
- Always prioritize safety and code compliance
- Document decisions and changes as the project progresses
- Take photos at each major milestone
- Keep all receipts and warranty information

## DIY Philosophy & Guidelines

This is a **100% DIY project**. All research, planning, and documentation should support a homeowner doing this work themselves.

### Cost Tracking Principles
1. **Material Costs**: Track actual costs for all materials purchased
2. **Tool Costs**: Track separately (one-time investment, may be useful for future projects)
3. **Labor Costs**: Include professional installation quotes in a separate column for reference
   - Purpose: To quantify DIY savings
   - These costs are NOT included in project totals
   - Helps justify tool purchases and time investment

### Research Focus for DIY
When researching products, methods, or techniques, always consider:
- **Skill Level Required**: Can a motivated beginner do this?
- **Learning Curve**: How much practice/experience needed?
- **Mistake Recovery**: How forgiving is this material/method if you mess up?
- **Tool Requirements**: Special tools needed? Can they be rented?
- **Time Investment**: Realistic time for first-time installer?
- **Professional Help**: When is it better/required to hire an expert?

### When to Call a Professional
Even in a DIY project, some tasks may require professional help:
- **Electrical work**: Many jurisdictions require licensed electrician
- **Structural issues**: If subfloor has damage or rot
- **Permit/Inspection**: Some areas require professional sign-off
- **Complex plumbing**: If toilet flange or pipes need work

Document these decisions and costs separately if they occur.
