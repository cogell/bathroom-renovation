# Thin-Set Mortar

**TL;DR**: Schluter ALL-SET is their universal thin-set that works everywhere in their system, eliminating confusion about modified vs. unmodified requirements.

**Summary**:

- Modified vs. unmodified thin-set rules are complex and critical
- Wrong thin-set type is the #1 installation failure
- ALL-SET works both under and over all Schluter products
- Unmodified required over waterproof membranes for proper curing
- DITRA-HEAT-PS (peel-and-stick) eliminates thin-set needs for membrane installation

## Understanding Modified vs. Unmodified

### What's the Difference?

**Unmodified Thin-Set**:

- Portland cement, sand, and water retention compounds
- Cures by hydration (chemical reaction with water)
- Can cure in wet conditions or underwater
- Faster initial cure (24-48 hours)

**Modified Thin-Set**:

- Contains polymer additives (latex or acrylic)
- Needs air exposure to fully cure
- Stronger bond and more flexibility when cured
- Slower cure time (28+ days for full cure)
- Better for challenging substrates

### Why It Matters for Waterproof Membranes

```
The Problem with Modified over DITRA:

Porcelain Tile (waterproof)
    ↓
Modified Thin-Set (needs air to cure)
    ↓
DITRA Membrane (waterproof)

Result: Trapped moisture, thin-set never cures properly
```

When modified thin-set is sandwiched between two waterproof layers (DITRA below, porcelain tile above), it cannot dry out and will remain soft indefinitely, leading to tile failure.

## Schluter ALL-SET - The Universal Solution

### What Is ALL-SET?

- Schluter's proprietary modified thin-set mortar
- Specially formulated to work with ALL Schluter products
- Eliminates confusion about which thin-set to use where
- Gray color, smooth consistency

### Where ALL-SET Can Be Used

| Application                | Traditional Requirement | ALL-SET |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| Under DITRA on wood        | Unmodified              | ✓ Works |
| Under DITRA on concrete    | Modified or Unmodified  | ✓ Works |
| Over DITRA (setting tiles) | Unmodified ONLY         | ✓ Works |
| Installing KERDI on walls  | Unmodified              | ✓ Works |
| Setting KERDI-BOARD        | Unmodified              | ✓ Works |
| KERDI-BAND installation    | Unmodified              | ✓ Works |
| Setting tiles over KERDI   | Unmodified              | ✓ Works |

### ALL-SET Specifications

## Traditional Thin-Set Rules for Schluter

### If NOT Using ALL-SET, Follow These Rules:

#### Under DITRA/DITRA-HEAT

- **Wood subfloor**: Unmodified thin-set ONLY
- **Concrete subfloor**: Modified OR unmodified (both work)
- **Gypsum**: Special primer + appropriate thin-set

#### Over DITRA/DITRA-HEAT (Setting Tiles)

- **ALWAYS unmodified thin-set**
- Never use modified (won't cure)
- Exception: Natural stone may use modified if stone is porous

#### KERDI Membrane Installation

- **Unmodified thin-set only**
- On drywall, cement board, or masonry
- Never use modified

#### KERDI-BAND at Seams

- **Unmodified thin-set only**
- Same product as used for membrane

## Approved Alternative Thin-Sets

### Unmodified Thin-Sets (For Over DITRA)

- **Custom Building Products**: Unmodified Thin-Set Mortar
- **MAPEI**: Kerabond
- **Laticrete**: 317
- **TEC**: Full Set Plus
- **Ardex**: X 77

### For Under DITRA (Wood Subfloor)

Same unmodified list as above

### For Under DITRA (Concrete)

Can use modified if preferred:

- **MAPEI**: Porcelain Tile Mortar
- **Laticrete**: 253 Gold
- **Custom**: VersaBond

## Application Requirements by Product

### DITRA-HEAT Traditional (Not Peel-and-Stick)

**Installing Membrane**:

- Trowel: 1/4" x 3/16" V-notch (MUST use correct size)
- Coverage: ~40 sq ft per bag
- Working time: 20-30 minutes per batch

**Setting Tiles Over**:

- Trowel size depends on tile:
  - Mosaic: 1/4" x 3/16" V-notch
  - 12"x12" or smaller: 1/4" x 1/4" square-notch
  - 12"x24" or larger: 1/4" x 3/8" or 1/2" x 1/2" square-notch
- Back-butter large format tiles

### DITRA-HEAT-PS (Peel-and-Stick)

**Installing Membrane**:

- NO thin-set needed!
- Just peel and stick

**Setting Tiles Over**:

- Same as traditional DITRA-HEAT
- Still need unmodified thin-set (or ALL-SET)

### KERDI-BAND Installation

- Trowel: 1/4" x 3/16" V-notch
- Apply to wall and floor overlap area
- Embed band immediately
- Smooth with putty knife

## Cost Analysis

### Price Comparison (50 lb bag)

| Product            | Price  | Coverage     | Cost/sq ft |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| ALL-SET            | $18-25 | 90-100 sq ft | $0.20-0.28 |
| Generic Unmodified | $12-15 | 90-100 sq ft | $0.13-0.17 |
| Generic Modified   | $15-20 | 90-100 sq ft | $0.17-0.22 |

### Project Cost Estimate (50 sq ft bathroom)

**Using ALL-SET Throughout**:

- Under DITRA (if not P&S): 2 bags = $40-50
- KERDI-BAND installation: 1 bag = $20-25
- Setting tiles: 3 bags = $60-75
- **Total: $120-150**

**Using Generic Unmodified**:

- Under DITRA (if not P&S): 2 bags = $24-30
- KERDI-BAND installation: 1 bag = $12-15
- Setting tiles: 3 bags = $36-45
- **Total: $72-90**

**Savings with DITRA-HEAT-PS**:

- Eliminate 2 bags for membrane installation
- Save $24-50 depending on product choice

## Common Mistakes

### Fatal Errors

1. **Using modified thin-set over DITRA** - Won't cure, tiles fail
2. **Wrong trowel size** - Poor adhesion, voids warranty
3. **Mixing types** - Using different products for membrane vs. tiles
4. **Old thin-set** - Using expired product (check dates)

### Mix Mistakes

1. **Too much water** - Weakens bond, causes shrinkage
2. **Partial bag mixing** - Incorrect ratios
3. **Over-mixing** - Entrains air, weakens bond
4. **Re-tempering** - Adding water to stiffening mix

### Application Errors

1. **Skinned over thin-set** - Applying over dried surface
2. **Not back-buttering** - Large tiles need extra coverage
3. **Wrong coverage** - Less than 95% for wet areas
4. **Direction changes** - Trowel ridges should be parallel

## Recommendations for This Project

### Option 1: Premium (Recommended)

**Use ALL-SET throughout**

- No confusion about types
- Guaranteed compatibility
- Full warranty support
- Extra $30-50 total cost for peace of mind

### Option 2: Budget

**Use quality unmodified throughout**

- Careful product selection
- Must verify "unmodified" on every bag
- Save ~$50 on materials
- Higher risk of error

### Option 3: DITRA-HEAT-PS + ALL-SET

**Peel-and-stick membrane + ALL-SET for tiles**

- Faster installation
- Less thin-set needed (3-4 bags total)
- Simplified process
- Higher membrane cost offset by labor savings

### Shopping List

#### For ALL-SET Approach:

- [ ] ALL-SET: 5-6 bags @ $20 each = $100-120
- [ ] 1/4" x 3/16" V-notch trowel = $15
- [ ] 1/4" x 1/4" square-notch trowel = $15
- [ ] Mixing paddle = $20
- [ ] 5-gallon buckets (2) = $10

#### For Generic Unmodified:

- [ ] Unmodified thin-set: 5-6 bags @ $13 each = $65-78
- [ ] Same trowels and tools as above

## Tips for Success

### Mixing

1. Use cool, clean water
2. Mix with drill at 150-200 RPM
3. Let slake for 5-10 minutes
4. Remix briefly before use
5. Don't mix more than you can use in 30 minutes

### Application

1. Key in thin-set to substrate first
2. Use proper trowel angle (45°)
3. Comb in straight, parallel lines
4. Check coverage by lifting a tile
5. Clean tools before thin-set hardens

### Working in Sections

- Mix small batches (1/2 bag max)
- Complete one wall or 20 sq ft at a time
- Keep thin-set covered when not using
- Clean bucket between batches

## Summary

For your Schluter system bathroom renovation:

1. **ALL-SET is the safest choice** - eliminates all confusion
2. **If using generic, must be unmodified** over DITRA
3. **DITRA-HEAT-PS eliminates membrane thin-set** - saves labor
4. **Wrong thin-set = project failure** - not worth the risk
5. **Budget $100-150 for thin-set** regardless of type chosen

The extra cost for ALL-SET ($30-50) is minimal insurance against the most common installation failure. For a DIY project where you're learning as you go, it's highly recommended.
