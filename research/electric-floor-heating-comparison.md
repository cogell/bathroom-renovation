# Electric Floor Heating - Research & Brainstorming

**Research Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Exploration phase - NO DECISIONS MADE YET
**Purpose**: Evaluate electric floor heating options for small bathroom in 1870 house

---

## Project Context

### Bathroom Specifications
- **Heated Area**: Approximately 27 sq ft
  - Total bathroom: ~6' x 6' (36 sq ft)
  - Washer/dryer zone: ~3' x 3' (9 sq ft) - no heating needed
  - Actual heated zone: ~27 sq ft
- **House Age**: 1870 (with previous renovations)
- **Subfloor**: Unknown condition - possibly planks, possibly plywood with water damage
- **Location**: Above basement (insulation access from below)

### Project Constraints
- **Budget**: Low-mid range, but not willing to sacrifice performance
- **Approach**: 100% DIY including subfloor repair
- **Sound Control**: Not needed/wanted
- **Basement Access**: Yes - can install rockwool insulation from below

---

## Initial Attraction: Schluter DITRA-HEAT-DUO

### What Makes DUO Appealing (The "All-in-One" Factor)
- Uncoupling membrane + waterproofing + heating + sound control + thermal break = single product
- Claims 70% faster heat-up than regular DITRA-HEAT (90 minutes faster in testing)
- No self-leveling compound required over cables
- 5/16" (8mm) profile relatively thin
- Snap-in cable system - elegant installation

### Key Features of DITRA-DUO
- **Integrated thermal break**: 2mm anchoring fleece on underside
- **Sound control**: IIC value of 60 over concrete
- **Waterproofing**: Built-in vapor management
- **Uncoupling**: Prevents tile cracking from substrate movement
- **Heat-up speed**: Up to 70% faster over concrete substrates

---

## Why DITRA-DUO May NOT Be Right for This Project

### Features That Don't Apply to This Situation

1. **Sound Control** ($$ paid for feature not needed)
   - DUO's main advantage is sound dampening for multi-story buildings
   - We don't care about sound transmission
   - Paying premium for unused feature

2. **Thermal Break Benefits** (Reduced value in this context)
   - Primary benefit is faster heat-up over *concrete* slabs
   - We have *wood* subfloor over basement
   - Can insulate from below with rockwool = better thermal performance than DUO's 2mm fleece
   - The thermal break advantage largely disappears when properly insulated from below

3. **Premium Pricing for Limited Gain**
   - DUO costs more than regular DITRA-HEAT
   - Regular DITRA-HEAT costs more than alternative systems
   - For our specific conditions, not getting proportional performance benefit

### Known Disadvantages of DITRA-DUO

**Cost Issues:**
- DITRA products can be "shockingly expensive" - sometimes more than tile
- "Eats thinset by the bags" - requires substantial material
- Requires two types of thinset (unmodified below and above)
- Can be hard to trowel properly

**Application Limitations:**
- Thermal break insufficient for uninsulated concrete basement slabs
- Best suited for elevated structures (condos, apartments)
- Over wood with basement insulation = thermal break advantage is marginal

**When NOT to Use:**
- Uninsulated ground-level concrete slabs (insufficient insulation value)
- When sound control isn't needed (paying for unused feature)
- When basement insulation is practical alternative

---

## Alternative Systems to Consider

### Option A: Regular DITRA-HEAT (Not DUO)

**What You Get:**
- Uncoupling membrane + waterproofing + heating (no sound control, no thermal break)
- Thinner profile: 1/4" vs DUO's 5/16"
- Same snap-in cable system
- Same Schluter quality and warranty
- Proven system with extensive documentation

**What You Lose vs DUO:**
- Faster heat-up claim (but over wood with basement insulation, this is marginal anyway)
- Sound control (don't need it)
- Thermal break (can achieve better results with basement insulation)

**Cost Savings:**
- Regular DITRA-HEAT cheaper than DUO
- Still premium-priced compared to other systems

**Performance for Your Situation:**
- Virtually identical to DUO once you insulate basement
- Heat-up speed difference negligible on insulated wood subfloor

### Option B: Loose Cable System + Budget Uncoupling Membrane

**Example Combinations:**
- WarmlyYours cables + ProvaFlex membrane
- SunTouch WarmWire + Custom Easy Mat
- Nuheat cable + generic uncoupling membrane

**Advantages:**
- **Lowest material cost**: $5-8/sq ft vs $10-12+ for DITRA systems
- **Maximum layout flexibility**: Perfect for odd 6x6 minus 3x3 shape
- **Precise cable placement**: Put heat exactly where you want it
- **Avoid washer/dryer area easily**: Custom routing
- **Same heating performance**: Same wire technology as mats

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires self-leveling compound over cables (extra step + material cost)
- Longer installation time than mat systems
- Need to plan cable spacing carefully (3" spacing for 12W/sq ft)
- More room for DIY error if not careful

**Heat-Up Performance:**
- Identical to any mat system (same wire, same thermal characteristics)
- Cable vs mat makes NO difference in heat-up speed

### Option C: Loose Cables + Cement Board (Budget Option)

**If Budget is Tight:**
- Cheapest approach overall
- Cement board is traditional, proven, widely available
- Install cables in thinset, then tile over

**Advantages:**
- Lowest cost
- Proven traditional method
- Widely available materials

**Disadvantages:**
- Heavier than membrane systems
- Raises floor height more than membranes
- No uncoupling (requires excellent subfloor prep)
- Less forgiving if subfloor moves

**When This Makes Sense:**
- Very tight budget
- Subfloor is solid and properly repaired
- Comfortable with traditional methods

## Heat-Up Speed Research

### Key Findings About Warm-Up Times

**General Electric Radiant Floor Heating:**
- Typical warm-up: 30-60 minutes for most systems
- Small bathroom (27 sq ft) heats faster than large areas
- Heat-up depends on:
  - Insulation below subfloor (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - Tile thermal mass
  - Wattage per sq ft
  - Subfloor material (wood vs concrete)

**Cable vs Mat - NO DIFFERENCE:**
- Both use identical wire technology
- Pre-spaced mat vs manually-spaced cable = same performance
- Only difference is installation method, not heat output

**DITRA-DUO's 70% Faster Claim:**
- **Context matters**: This is comparing to systems *without* thermal break over *concrete*
- Over concrete: Thermal break directs heat up instead of into slab = significant time savings
- Over wood: Less heat loss to begin with = thermal break advantage is marginal
- **With basement insulation**: You've already solved the heat loss problem more effectively

**What Actually Matters for Heat-Up Speed:**
1. **Basement insulation** (rockwool from below) - BIGGEST IMPACT
2. Wattage density (12W vs 15W per sq ft)
3. Tile type (porcelain vs natural stone)
4. Thermostat programming (warm-up schedules)

**Operating Costs for 27 sq ft:**
- 27 sq ft @ 12W = 324W draw
- 4 hours/day operation ≈ $2-3/month (at $0.13/kWh)
- Small space = low operating cost regardless of system

## Critical Research Priorities

### 1. Subfloor Assessment (MUST DO FIRST)

**Why This is Priority #1:**
- All heating system decisions depend on subfloor condition
- Water damage could indicate structural issues
- Bad subfloor = wasted money on premium systems
- May discover issues that change entire project scope

**What to Research:**
- How to assess 1870s-era wood subfloor
- Identifying planks vs plywood in old houses
- Water damage severity assessment (structural vs cosmetic)
- When to call structural engineer/pro
- Joist condition and spacing standards for 1870 construction

**What to Check:**
- Is subfloor planks or plywood?
- Water damage extent and cause (still active? resolved?)
- Structural integrity - any soft spots, rot, or sagging?
- Joist spacing and condition
- Any signs of previous repairs
- Moisture levels before starting work

**Potential Outcomes:**
- **Minor issues**: DIY repair, proceed with project
- **Moderate damage**: Replace sections, sister joists, then proceed
- **Major problems**: May need professional structural assessment
- **Discovery of other issues**: Plumbing, electrical, etc.

### 2. Basement Insulation Strategy

**Why This Matters More Than System Choice:**
- Proper insulation from below provides better thermal break than DITRA-DUO's 2mm fleece
- Reduces heat loss significantly
- Improves efficiency of ANY heating system chosen
- One-time investment that pays off forever

**What to Research:**
- Rockwool insulation for floor joists (between joists from below)
- R-value recommendations for heated floors (how much insulation?)
- Installation methods - friction fit vs fasteners
- Air sealing strategies
- Vapor barrier considerations (if any)
- Fire code compliance for exposed insulation in basement

**Questions to Answer:**
- What R-value rockwool to use? (R-15? R-19? R-23?)
- How to secure insulation between joists?
- Do you need vapor barrier in this application?
- Any fire code issues with exposed rockwool?
- Cost of insulation for ~27 sq ft coverage

**Expected Benefits:**
- Faster heat-up times (heat goes up, not down)
- Lower operating costs
- Better performance from cheaper heating systems
- Year-round benefit (also helps with cold floors in winter even before heating system)

### 3. Cost Comparison for Your 27 Sq Ft

**Need Real Prices:**
- DITRA-HEAT-DUO complete kit for 27 sq ft
- Regular DITRA-HEAT for 27 sq ft
- Loose cable system (e.g., SunTouch) + uncoupling membrane
- Budget option: cables + cement board

**Include All Materials:**
- Heating system
- Uncoupling/underlayment
- Thinset (amounts vary by system!)
- Self-leveling compound (if needed)
- Thermostat (can use same one for any system)
- Testing equipment (ohm meter if don't have)

**Compare Total Project Cost:**
- System materials
- Subfloor repair materials
- Basement insulation
- Tile and grout
- Tools needed (if any)

### 4. Cable Layout Planning for Odd Shape

**Your Layout Challenge:**
- 6x6 room = 36 sq ft total
- 3x3 washer/dryer = 9 sq ft to avoid
- Toilet, vanity, possibly other fixtures
- Actual heated area ≈ 27 sq ft or less

**Why Layout Matters:**
- Pre-sized mats may not fit efficiently
- Loose cables offer custom routing
- Need to avoid all fixtures (3-4" clearance)
- Want heat in high-traffic areas

**What to Map:**
- Exact fixture locations
- Traffic patterns (where you walk)
- Where heat is most wanted
- Cold lead routing to thermostat location
- Electrical location planning

**Mat vs Cable Decision Depends On:**
- Can you find pre-sized mat that fits your layout?
- How much of mat would be wasted/trimmed?
- Is custom cable routing worth the extra installation complexity?
- Your comfort level with cable spacing calculations
