## System Types Overview

### Heating Mats vs. Heating Cables

| Feature | Heating Mats | Heating Cables |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Installation Speed** | Faster - pre-spaced heating elements | Slower - manual spacing required |
| **Best For** | Regularly shaped rooms | Irregular shapes, many fixtures |
| **Flexibility** | Limited - fixed spacing | High - custom layouts |
| **Cost** | Higher initial cost | 20-30% less than mats |
| **Skill Level** | DIY-friendly | More technical expertise needed |
| **Heat Coverage** | Uniform, predetermined | Customizable density |
| **Typical Spacing** | Pre-set at 3" (12W/sq.ft) | Variable: 2.5"-3.5" |

### Key Takeaway
- **Choose Mats**: For simple rectangular bathrooms, faster installation, DIY projects
- **Choose Cables**: For bathrooms with many fixtures (toilet, vanity, tub), cost savings, custom heat zones

## Additional Considerations

### Bathroom-Specific Factors

**Moisture Protection**:
- Schluter offers integrated waterproofing
- Others require separate waterproof membrane
- All systems are rated for wet locations
- GFCI protection is required and built into thermostats

**Tile Compatibility**:
- All systems work with ceramic/porcelain tile
- Natural stone requires careful heat settings
- Larger tiles (12"+ ) recommended over small mosaic
- Consider thermal expansion with stone tiles

**Coverage Planning**:
- Heat 80-90% of open floor space
- Avoid heating under toilet, vanity, bathtub
- Leave 3-4" gap from walls and fixtures
- Focus heat in traffic areas

### Building Code Compliance

**Typical Requirements**:
- Dedicated circuit for heating system
- GFCI protection (all systems include via thermostat)
- Licensed electrician for electrical connections
- May require electrical permit
- Check local building codes before purchasing

### Long-Term Considerations

**Reliability**:
- All major brands have proven track records
- Proper installation is critical (test before/during/after)
- Lifetime of system typically exceeds tile lifetime
- Keep installation records and ohm readings

**Repairability**:
- Systems are generally non-repairable once tiled
- Must remove tile to access damaged cables
- Importance of proper installation and testing
- Consider extended warranties

**Resale Value**:
- Heated floors add 6-8% home value
- Homes sell faster with heated floors
- Premium brands may have better perceived value
- Market varies by region (more valuable in cold climates)
