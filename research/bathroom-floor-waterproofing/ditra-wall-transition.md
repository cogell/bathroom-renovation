# DITRA-to-Wall Waterproofing

**TL;DR**: DITRA must be sealed at wall transitions using KERDI-BAND or KERDI membrane to create a continuous waterproof envelope.

**Summary**:

- DITRA stops 1/8" from walls (gap for expansion)
- KERDI-BAND bridges the gap and turns up the wall
- Creates minimum 2" overlap on DITRA and 2-3" up wall
- Silicone sealant is NOT sufficient alone
- This detail is critical for complete waterproofing

## Why This Transition Matters

### The Problem Areas

```
Wall (drywall/cement board)
    |
    |← Water can wick up here
    |
    GAP (1/8" expansion gap)
    |
[DITRA MAT]════════════
    ↑
Water on floor can get under mat
```

### Without Proper Sealing

- Water gets under edge of DITRA
- Wicks up into wall materials
- Causes rot, mold, and damage behind walls
- Creates pathway for moisture migration
- Voids warranty

## Standard Wall Transition Methods

### Schluter-Approved Options

1. **KERDI-BAND** - Most common, economical
2. **KERDI membrane** - For full wall waterproofing
3. **KERDI-FIX or similar sealant** - Limited applications

### What NOT to Use

- Silicone caulk alone (not sufficient)
- Grout at the wall (will crack)
- Nothing (obviously fails)
- Non-approved waterproofing products (voids warranty)

## Method 1: KERDI-BAND (Most Common)

### Materials Needed

- KERDI-BAND 5" or 7.25" wide
- Unmodified thin-set (or ALL-SET)
- 1/4" x 3/16" V-notched trowel
- 4-6" putty knife

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Install DITRA

- Stop DITRA 1/8" to 1/4" from wall
- This gap allows for expansion/contraction
- Press firmly into thin-set

#### Step 2: Prepare Wall Surface

- Wall must be clean and flat
- Can apply to:
  - Painted drywall (if well-adhered)
  - Cement board
  - Existing tile (if secure)
  - Primed surfaces

#### Step 3: Apply KERDI-BAND

```
Wall Surface
    ↑
    | 2-3" minimum
    |
KERDI-BAND (5" wide)
    |
    | 2" minimum overlap
    ↓
════[DITRA MAT]════
```

**Application Process**:

1. Mix unmodified thin-set
2. Apply thin-set to wall (2-3" up)
3. Apply thin-set over edge of DITRA (2" in)
4. Embed KERDI-BAND into thin-set
5. Smooth with putty knife
6. Remove all air bubbles
7. Ensure full contact

#### Step 4: Inside Corners

- Use KERDI-KERECK-F (pre-formed corners)
- Or overlap KERDI-BAND pieces (minimum 2")
- Critical at shower-to-floor transitions

#### Step 5: Outside Corners

- Use KERDI-KERECK-F for outside corners
- Or carefully fold KERDI-BAND
- Ensure no gaps in coverage

### Coverage Requirements

- **5" KERDI-BAND**: 2" on DITRA + 3" up wall
- **7.25" KERDI-BAND**: 2" on DITRA + 5.25" up wall
- **Overlap at seams**: Minimum 2" always

## Method 2: Full KERDI Membrane

### When to Use

- Wet areas (behind tub, shower walls)
- Full wall waterproofing desired
- Steam shower applications
- Commercial requirements

### Installation

```
Wall
    |
Full KERDI membrane
    |\
    | \
    |  \ Overlap
    |   \
════[DITRA]════
```

**Process**:

1. Install DITRA first
2. Apply KERDI to entire wall
3. Overlap onto DITRA minimum 2"
4. Use same thin-set application method

### Benefits

- Complete wall protection
- No seams at critical floor/wall junction
- Best for wet areas
- Professional appearance

## Method 3: Other Approved Sealants

### KERDI-FIX or KERDI-COLL

**Limited Use Cases**:

- Small repairs
- Penetrations (pipes, etc.)
- NOT recommended as primary method for floor/wall

### Application If Used

1. Clean and dry surfaces
2. Apply generous bead in gap
3. Tool smooth
4. Still recommend KERDI-BAND over top

## Special Situations

### Shower-to-Bathroom Floor Transition

```
Shower Pan (Schluter)
    |
    |← KERDI on wall
    |
━━━━━━━━━ Curb
    |← KERDI-BAND wraps over
    |
[DITRA]━━━ Bathroom floor
```

**Critical**: KERDI-BAND must connect both waterproofing systems

### Bathtub Transitions

#### For Tub with Flange

1. DITRA stops at tub edge
2. KERDI-BAND from DITRA up wall (behind tub flange)
3. Overlap minimum 2" each direction
4. Seal tub flange to wall separately

#### For Freestanding Tub

1. DITRA under tub location
2. KERDI-BAND around entire perimeter
3. Extra attention to plumbing penetrations

### Door Thresholds

```
        Door
         |
    [Threshold]
         |
    KERDI-BAND
         |
    [DITRA MAT]
```

**Options**:

1. KERDI-BAND under threshold, up both sides
2. Terminate DITRA at threshold cleanly
3. Silicone seal after tile installation

### Toilet Flange Area

**DO NOT run DITRA under toilet flange**

Proper method:

1. Cut DITRA around flange location
2. Use KERDI-SEAL-PS (pressure sensitive) gasket
3. Or use KERDI-FIX sealant around flange
4. Toilet sits on finished tile, not DITRA

## Common Mistakes

### Fatal Errors

1. **No sealing at all** - Water gets under everything
2. **Silicone only** - Not adequate, will fail
3. **Grout at wall** - Will crack with movement
4. **DITRA touching wall** - No expansion gap

### Installation Errors

1. **Insufficient overlap** - Less than 2" will fail
2. **Air bubbles** - Create weak points
3. **Wrong thin-set** - Modified where unmodified required
4. **Painted over** - Sealing KERDI-BAND with paint

### Material Mistakes

1. **Using mesh tape** - Not waterproof
2. **Regular caulk** - Breaks down over time
3. **Skipping corners** - Most vulnerable points
4. **Incomplete coverage** - Gaps in protection

## Testing the Seal

### Flood Test Procedure

**Before tiling**:

1. Dam doorways with clay/hydraulic cement
2. Apply blue tape at wall 2" above floor
3. Fill floor with 1" of water
4. Mark water level precisely
5. Wait 24-72 hours
6. Check for:
   - Water level drop
   - Wet spots on walls
   - Leaks below

### Pass/Fail Criteria

- **Pass**: No water loss, no wet walls
- **Fail**: ANY water loss or wall moisture
- If failed: Find leak, repair, retest

## Product List & Costs

### Basic Wall Transition (per bathroom)

- KERDI-BAND 5" x 33' roll: ~$40
- KERDI-KERECK-F corners (4): ~$32
- Unmodified thin-set (1 bag): ~$15
- **Total**: ~$87

### Full Wall Protection

- KERDI membrane 3'3" x 33' roll: ~$130
- KERDI-BAND for seams: ~$40
- Corners and details: ~$40
- Thin-set (2-3 bags): ~$45
- **Total**: ~$255

## Installation Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Work in sections** - Don't rush
2. **Keep thin-set fresh** - Small batches
3. **Use proper trowel** - Ensures adhesion
4. **Check coverage** - Lift corner to verify
5. **Photo document** - Before covering with tile

### Temperature Considerations

- Install above 50°F
- Allow to cure 24 hours before flood test
- Don't tile immediately - ensure full bond

### Sequencing

1. Install DITRA first
2. Then KERDI-BAND at walls
3. Then corners and details
4. Flood test
5. Then tile

## Your Specific Application

Since you're using DITRA-HEAT with a Schluter shower pan:

### Recommended Approach

1. **Use KERDI-BAND 5"** for most wall transitions
2. **Use KERDI-BAND 7.25"** at shower transition
3. **KERDI-KERECK-F** at all corners
4. **Connect to shower pan** waterproofing

### Shopping List

- [ ] 2 rolls KERDI-BAND 5" (for perimeter)
- [ ] 1 roll KERDI-BAND 7.25" (for shower area)
- [ ] 6-8 KERDI-KERECK-F corners
- [ ] 2-3 bags unmodified thin-set
- [ ] KERDI-FIX for details (optional)

### Critical Connections

1. **DITRA to regular wall**: KERDI-BAND 5"
2. **DITRA to shower curb**: KERDI-BAND 7.25"
3. **Corner at shower entrance**: KERDI-KERECK-F
4. **Around toilet**: KERDI-SEAL-PS or KERDI-FIX

## Summary

The wall transition is NOT optional - it's essential for complete waterproofing. DITRA provides the horizontal waterproofing, but without properly sealed edges, water will find its way underneath and into your walls.

**The minimum acceptable method**:

- KERDI-BAND at all wall transitions
- 2" overlap onto DITRA
- 2-3" up the wall
- Pre-formed corners at all corners
- Proper thin-set installation

This adds about $87 to your project but prevents thousands in water damage. There's no acceptable reason to skip this critical detail.
