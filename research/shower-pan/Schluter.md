- **Cutting tools**: Utility knife or handsaw

## Installation Process

### Step 1: Planning & Measurement
- Verify drain location matches tray or can be adjusted
- Check that existing drain is 2" (not 1.5")
- Ensure subfloor is level and structurally sound
- Plan wall waterproofing strategy

### Step 2: Subfloor Preparation
**Requirements**:
- Clean, even, and load-bearing substrate
- Level within 1/8" over 10 feet
- Wood or concrete acceptable
- Fix any deflection issues before installation

### Step 3: Drain Installation
1. Install KERDI-DRAIN flange at correct height
2. Connect to 2" waste pipe
3. Use included gasket and bolts
4. Ensure drain is level with planned tray bottom

### Step 4: Setting the Tray

**Mortar Application**:
1. Mix unmodified thin-set or Schluter ALL-SET
2. Apply with 1/4" x 3/8" square or U-notched trowel
3. Cover entire tray footprint
4. Use directional troweling technique

**Tray Placement**:
1. Set tray into fresh mortar immediately
2. Press firmly to ensure full coverage
3. Check level and proper slope to drain
4. Verify perimeter height is consistent

### Step 5: Waterproofing Membrane Installation

**Wall Preparation**:
- Can apply KERDI directly to:
  - Clean, unfinished drywall
  - Cement board
  - KERDI-BOARD
- Do NOT finish drywall with joint compound

**KERDI Application**:
1. Apply thin-set to wall with 1/4" x 3/16" V-notched trowel
2. Install KERDI membrane, overlapping tray by 2"
3. Smooth with drywall knife to ensure adhesion
4. Remove air bubbles and wrinkles

### Step 6: Sealing Joints & Corners

**KERDI-BAND Installation**:
- All seams require 5" or 7.25" KERDI-BAND
- 2" minimum overlap on all joints
- Use KERDI-KERECK for corners
- KERDI-SEAL for pipe penetrations

**Critical Areas**:
- Tray-to-wall connection
- Wall corners (inside and outside)
- Curb-to-tray and curb-to-wall joints
- All membrane overlaps

#### KERDI-BAND Only Method (Retrofit Option)
For retrofit installations with minimal wall exposure (5-6"), KERDI-BAND alone can provide complete waterproofing:

**When to Use**:
- Retrofit with 6" or less wall exposure
- Budget-conscious installations
- Partial wall removal scenarios

**Application**:
- Use 7.25" wide KERDI-BAND
- Apply with 2" on pan, 5.25" up wall
- No additional membrane needed for small areas
- Same waterproofing effectiveness as full membrane

**Cost Savings**:
- KERDI-BAND roll: ~$40
- Full KERDI membrane: ~$130-150
- Savings: ~$90-110

### Step 7: Curb Installation (if applicable)
1. Set curb in thin-set mortar
2. Apply KERDI-BAND to all curb joints
3. Wrap entire curb with KERDI membrane
4. Ensure proper slope on top of curb

### Step 8: Flood Testing
**Required before tiling**:
1. Block drain with test plug
2. Fill to just below curb height
3. Mark water level
4. Wait 24-72 hours (per local code)
5. Verify no water loss
6. Document for inspection

### Step 9: Tile Installation
**Can begin immediately after successful test**:
- Use polymer-modified thin-set for tiles
- Large format tiles require proper support
- Follow TCNA guidelines for tile installation
- Grout with appropriate product for joint width

## Common Questions

### Can I use modified thin-set?
Schluter recommends unmodified thin-set under the tray and membrane. Modified is OK for setting tiles over cured KERDI.

### Do I need to use KERDI-BOARD on walls?
No, KERDI membrane can go over regular drywall or cement board. KERDI-BOARD is an alternative, not required.

### Can I cut the tray to fit?
Yes, but cut equally on all sides to maintain consistent perimeter height. Maximum 6" per side typically.

### What if my drain is 1.5"?
You'll need to transition to 2" somewhere in the plumbing system. KERDI-DRAIN requires 2" connection.

### How long before I can tile?
You can tile immediately after the membrane is installed and flood test is complete. No waiting for cure time.

### Is the warranty really lifetime?
Yes, when installed per Schluter's instructions and with complete Schluter shower system components.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Installation Issues

**Problem**: Tray rocks or isn't level
**Solution**: Remove and check substrate levelness, add more thin-set

**Problem**: KERDI membrane bubbles
**Solution**: Work out bubbles immediately with drywall knife

**Problem**: Drain doesn't align
**Solution**: Tray can be trimmed up to 6" per side

**Problem**: Membrane won't stick to drywall
**Solution**: Ensure drywall is clean, unfinished, and dust-free

## Retrofit Installation Specifics

### When Replacing Pan with Existing Walls
Schluter is the **preferred system for retrofits** because:

1. **Flexible waterproofing**: KERDI membrane can overlap onto existing surfaces
2. **No upward flange**: Unlike KBRS, doesn't need to go behind walls
3. **KERDI-BAND option**: Can use band-only for 5-6" wall sections
4. **Trimable trays**: Can be cut to fit existing drain locations

### Retrofit Requirements
- **Minimum 5-6" wall removal** for proper installation
- Can use KERDI-BAND only (7.25" wide) for economy
- Overlap 2" onto pan, 5.25" up wall
- Total material cost for band: ~$40-50

### Retrofit Installation Sequence
1. Remove bottom 5-6" of wall tile/board
2. Install tray with thin-set
3. Patch cement board to proper height
4. Apply KERDI-BAND from pan up wall
5. Seal corners with KERDI-KERECK
6. Flood test before tiling

## Decision Summary

**Schluter Kerdi is ideal for DIYers who want**:
- Complete, proven system from one manufacturer
- Wide local availability
- Extensive support resources
- Professional-grade results
- Flexibility to customize on-site
- **Best option for retrofit installations**

**Consider alternatives if**:
- Simplest possible installation is priority
- Factory waterproofing preferred
- Budget is extremely tight
- Custom sizes needed beyond trimming capability
