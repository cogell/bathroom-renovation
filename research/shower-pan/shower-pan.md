## Current Situation

**TODO**: Document why the existing shower pan needed removal
- [ ] Describe the issue discovered
- [ ] Take photos of current state
- [ ] Measure shower dimensions
- [ ] Check drain location and type

## Research Priorities

**TODO**: Research the following key areas for shower pan replacement:

### Immediate Research Needs
1. **Types of shower pans available**
   - Pre-formed/prefabricated pans (acrylic, fiberglass, composite)
   - Custom tile-ready pans
   - Traditional mortar bed construction
   - Modern foam pan systems (Schluter, Wedi, etc.)

2. **Waterproofing methods**
   - Pan liner vs. liquid waterproofing
   - Waterproofing membrane systems
   - Integration with wall waterproofing

3. **Drainage considerations**
   - Drain type compatibility
   - Slope requirements (typically 1/4" per foot)
   - Weep hole protection

4. **Building code requirements**
   - Local permit requirements
   - Inspection needs
   - Required clearances and dimensions

## Shower Pan Types

### Modern Tile-Ready Foam Systems (RECOMMENDED)

Both KBRS and Schluter systems fall into this category - these are high-density foam or composite pans that come pre-sloped and ready for tile installation.

**Critical Difference - Wall Connection Method**:
- **KBRS**: Has a 5" perimeter flange that extends UP the wall behind cement board
- **Schluter**: Has a 1.5" edge; waterproofing membrane comes DOWN from wall to overlap the tray

This is one of the most important differences between the systems and affects installation sequence.

#### KBRS Shower Pan Systems

**Products**:
- **Tile-Basin¬Æ**: Factory-sloped, waterproofed composite pan
- **ShowerSlope‚Ñ¢**: Mortar-replacement solution that can be cut-to-fit

- Factory pre-sloped (eliminates puddling)
- Solid core construction - foot traffic OK immediately after installation
- Works with standard 3-piece tile shower drains
- Custom sizes available (any shape, size, drain location)

**Pros**:
- Installation time: Under 2 hours for DIYers
- No curing time before tiling (after 24-hour flood test)
- Pre-waterproofed from factory
- Uses standard modified thin-set
- Minimal tools required

**Cons**:
- Requires 3/4" wood subfloors

## KBRS vs. Schluter Comparison

| Feature | KBRS | Schluter |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Waterproofing** | Factory-applied coating | Requires membrane installation |
| **Wall Connection** | 5" flange goes UP under cement board | Membrane overlaps DOWN 2" onto tray |
| **Installation Time** | 2-4 hours | 3-5 hours |
| **Cost** | $300-$600 | $400-$800 |
| **Customization** | Can order custom sizes | Can trim to fit |
| **Drain Compatibility** | Standard 3-piece drains | Proprietary KERDI-DRAIN |
| **Learning Curve** | Slightly easier | More components to manage |
| **System Completeness** | Pan only (need separate waterproofing for walls) | Complete kit available |
| **Availability** | Direct order or specialty stores | Widely available at big box stores |

### Quick Decision Guide

**Choose KBRS if:**
- You want the simplest installation
- You need a custom size/shape
- You prefer factory waterproofing
- Budget is a primary concern

**Choose Schluter if:**
- You want a complete system from one manufacturer
- Local availability is important
- You prefer extensive documentation/videos
- You're already using other Schluter products

## Retrofit Installation Considerations

### Critical Decision Point
If you're **replacing a shower pan with existing wall tiles in place**, standard systems require modification:

- **KBRS**: Requires removing bottom 5-6" of wall to accommodate 5" upward flange
- **Schluter**: Requires removing bottom 5-6" of wall for proper membrane overlap
- **Neither system** works properly without some wall removal

### Recommended Retrofit Approach
1. Remove bottom 6" of wall tile and cement board
2. Install pan system (Schluter preferred for retrofits)
3. Use KERDI-BAND (7.25" wide) for economical waterproofing
4. Install accent tile strip or matching tiles

üìÑ **[See detailed Retrofit Considerations guide](./retrofit-considerations.md)** for complete retrofit instructions and options.

## Wall-to-Pan Connection Details

### KBRS Method (Flange UP)
```
Wall Stud
    |
    | ‚Üê 1/4" furring strip (REQUIRED)
    |
Cement Board ‚Üê hangs down over flange
    |
    |_____ 5" flange extends UP
         |
    [====Pan====]
```

**Why Furring Strips are Required**:
- Creates space for 5" flange to "free-float" behind cement board
- Without strips, screwing board to studs would crush the flange
- Crushing the flange would void warranty and cause leaks
- Allows for building movement without stressing waterproofing

**Installation Notes**:
- Flange must NOT be compressed or fastened
- Factory waterproofing extends 5" up wall
- Seal junction with PolySeal sealant
- **Retrofit Challenge**: Can't add furring strips without wall removal

### Schluter Method (Membrane DOWN)

#### Standard Full-Wall Installation:
```
Wall Stud
    |
Cement Board
    |
KERDI Membrane ‚Üê applied to wall
    |\
    | \ ‚Üê overlaps DOWN 2" minimum
    |  \
    [====Pan====] ‚Üê 1.5" perimeter edge
```

#### Retrofit with KERDI-BAND Only (5-6" walls):
```
Existing Wall (above cut)
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
New Cement Board (6")
    |
KERDI-BAND (7.25" wide)
    |‚Üê 5.25" up wall
    |‚Üê 2" overlap on pan
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
    [====Pan====]
```

**Installation Notes**:
- Membrane/band overlaps onto tray (not behind it)
- 2" minimum overlap required for waterproofing
- KERDI-BAND at all seams and transitions
- Creates continuous waterproofing envelope
- **Retrofit Advantage**: Can work with partial wall removal
