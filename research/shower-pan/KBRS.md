## Installation Process

### Step 1: Measuring (Critical for Custom Orders)
For accurate dimensions, you need four measurements:

1. **Width**: Stud to stud minus 1/2"
2. **Depth**: Stud to stud minus 1/2"
3. **Drain from side**: Stud to drain center minus 1/4"
4. **Drain from back**: Back wall to drain center minus 1/4"

**Example**: 48" wide alcove = order 47.5" pan

### Step 2: Subfloor Preparation
- Ensure 3/4" minimum thickness plywood subfloor
- If existing is 1/2", add 1/4" layer with:
  - 16d penny nails
  - Liquid Nails in 'S' pattern
- Subfloor must be level (not necessarily flat)

### Step 3: Drain Setup
- Cut 4.5" hole for drain assembly
- Ensure drain sits level with subfloor
- Connect to existing plumbing
- Verify no leaks before proceeding

### Step 4: Furring Strip Installation
**Critical for proper installation**:
- Add 1/4" furring strips to all wall studs
- Creates space for perimeter flange to "free-float"
- Allows backer board to hang straight and plumb
- Prevents pressure on flange when fastening backer board

### Step 5: Dry Fit
- Place Tile-Basin in shower area
- Verify drain alignment
- Check that all edges fit properly
- Mark any areas needing adjustment

### Step 6: Setting the Pan
1. Mix modified thin-set per manufacturer instructions
2. Apply with 1/4" x 3/8" square-notch trowel
3. Cover entire installation area
4. Use directional troweling (parallel lines)
5. Set pan immediately into thin-set
6. Apply firm, even pressure
7. Walk on pan to ensure full coverage
8. Check level and drain alignment

### Step 7: Backer Board Installation
- Install cement board or equivalent
- Board extends down over Tile-Basin flange
- Seal joint with KBRS PolySeal® sealant
- Tape and mud all seams

### Step 8: Flood Test (Required)
- Plug drain with test plug
- Fill pan with water to just below curb
- Mark water level
- Wait 24 hours minimum
- Check for any water level drop
- Document for inspection if required

### Step 9: Tile Installation
- Can begin immediately after successful flood test
- Use modified thin-set for tiles
- Standard tile installation practices apply
- Grout and seal per tile manufacturer specs

## Common Questions

### Can I cut the Tile-Basin to fit?
Not recommended for Tile-Basin (will void waterproofing warranty). Order custom size instead. ShowerSlope™ product can be field-cut.

### Do I need a special drain?
No, works with standard 2" or 3" three-piece shower drains. KBRS also sells compatible drains.

### What about wall waterproofing?
Tile-Basin only waterproofs the floor. You'll need separate wall waterproofing (RedGard, Kerdi membrane, etc.).

### Can I install over concrete?
Yes, but may need different adhesive. Contact KBRS technical support for recommendations.

### How long is the warranty?
Lifetime warranty on factory waterproofing when properly installed. Must follow installation instructions and perform flood test.

## Retrofit Considerations

### KBRS for Pan Replacement with Existing Walls

**IMPORTANT**: KBRS is **not ideal for retrofits** where walls remain in place.

**The Challenge**:
- The 5" flange MUST go behind cement board
- Cannot retrofit without removing bottom 5-6" of wall minimum
- Furring strips must be added to studs
- No way to properly install with walls intact

**If You Must Use KBRS for Retrofit**:
1. Remove minimum 6" of wall tile and cement board
2. Expose studs for furring strip installation
3. Install pan with flange going UP
4. Add 1/4" furring strips to all exposed studs
5. Install new cement board over flange
6. Seal with PolySeal sealant
7. Tile the exposed strip

**Why It's Difficult**:
- Requires more demolition than Schluter
- Furring strips complicate the installation
- Can't work around existing walls
- Flange must be behind board, not in front

**Better Alternative for Retrofits**: Schluter with KERDI-BAND

## Decision Summary

**KBRS is ideal for DIYers who want**:
- Maximum waterproofing confidence
- Fastest possible installation
- Custom sizing options
- Minimal waterproofing work
- Long-term warranty protection
- **New construction or full renovations**

**Consider alternatives if**:
- Budget is extremely tight
- Need same-day availability
- Want complete system from one manufacturer
- Prefer extensive local support
- **Doing a retrofit with existing walls**
