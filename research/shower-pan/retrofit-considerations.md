# Shower Pan Retrofit Considerations

**TL;DR**: Replacing a shower pan while keeping existing wall tiles intact is extremely challenging and often impossible to do properly.

**Summary**:
- True retrofit without touching walls violates waterproofing principles
- Minimum requirement: remove bottom 6-8" of wall tile
- KBRS difficult for retrofits due to 5" upward flange
- Schluter slightly better but still requires wall modification
- Consider full replacement if matching tiles unavailable

## The Retrofit Challenge

### What Makes Retrofit Different
- Existing wall tiles and cement board are in place
- Cannot access wall cavities or studs
- Must work within existing shower footprint
- Need to maintain waterproofing integrity

### The Waterproofing Problem
All proper shower installations require overlapping waterproofing layers:
```
Proper Installation:
Wall waterproofing
        ↓ (overlaps)
Pan waterproofing
```

With existing tiles, you cannot create this critical overlap.

## Why Standard Systems Don't Work

### KBRS System Limitations
```
Problem:
Existing Tile → Cement Board → Wall
                     |
                     ? ← Can't get 5" flange here!
                     |
              [New KBRS Pan]
```
- **5" flange must go BEHIND cement board**
- Would require removing bottom 5-6" of wall minimum
- Furring strips can't be added retroactively
- Even field-cuttable ShowerSlope™ expects wall integration

### Schluter System Limitations
```
Problem:
Existing Tile → Cement Board
              |
              ? ← No membrane to overlap!
              |
        [New Schluter Pan]
```
- **Requires KERDI membrane overlap from walls**
- Cannot install membrane under existing tiles
- Junction seal becomes single point of failure
- No manufacturer warranty for this application

## Viable Retrofit Options

### Option 1: Partial Wall Removal (BEST) ✅
**Remove bottom 5-6" of wall tile and cement board**

This is the **minimum viable approach** for proper waterproofing with modern systems.

#### For KBRS Installation (5-6" removal)
**Process**:
1. Mark line 6" up from current pan
2. Score grout lines with oscillating tool
3. Remove tiles carefully (save unbroken ones)
4. Cut cement board with oscillating saw
5. Install KBRS pan with 5" flange going UP
6. Add 1/4" furring strips to exposed studs
7. Patch with new cement board over flange
8. Seal junction with KBRS PolySeal
9. Install tiles (opportunity for accent strip)

**Key Point**: 5" flange requires exactly 5-6" of wall removal

#### For Schluter Installation (5-6" removal) - RECOMMENDED
**Process**:
1. Remove bottom 6" of wall tile and cement board
2. Install Schluter tray tight to walls
3. Patch cement board to near tray edge
4. Apply waterproofing using one of two methods:

**Method A: Full KERDI Membrane**
- Apply KERDI membrane to entire 6" strip
- Overlap 2" UP onto existing wall
- Overlap 2" DOWN onto pan
- KERDI-BAND at upper seam only

**Method B: KERDI-BAND Only (Economical)**
- Use 7.25" wide KERDI-BAND
- Apply with 2" on pan, 5.25" up wall
- Covers entire 6" exposed area
- Saves ~$100 vs full membrane
- Equally effective for small areas

**Pros**:
- Proper waterproofing with minimal demolition
- Both systems work with 5-6" removal
- Opportunity for decorative tile accent
- Full warranty when properly installed

**Cons**:
- Still requires some tile matching or accent design
- Dust and debris from cutting
- Need oscillating tool for clean cuts

**Best System for 5-6" Retrofit**:
- **Schluter with KERDI-BAND only** - Most economical
- **Schluter with full membrane** - Maximum protection
- **KBRS** - If you prefer factory waterproofing

### Option 2: Traditional Mud Bed Retrofit
**Build custom mortar bed with enhanced sealing**

**Process**:
1. Install PVC liner (6" up walls minimum)
2. Build pre-slope with deck mud
3. Install liner and weep hole protector
4. Build final slope with deck mud
5. Seal wall junction with:
   - Silicone sealant bead
   - Liquid waterproofing overlap (RedGard)
   - Caulk backer rod if gap exists

**Pros**:
- Can work with walls mostly intact
- Custom fit to existing space
- Traditional proven method

**Cons**:
- High skill requirement
- No warranty protection
- Multiple failure points
- Heavy (check floor structure)

### Option 3: Pre-formed Non-Tile Pan
**Install acrylic or fiberglass pan**

**Process**:
1. Find pan that fits opening (may need custom)
2. Minimal wall cutting for flange
3. Heavy silicone sealing at walls
4. Accept aesthetic mismatch

**Pros**:
- Truly waterproof unit
- Fast installation
- Low skill requirement
- Lightweight

**Cons**:
- Won't match tile walls
- May look "cheap"
- Limited size options
- Aesthetic compromise

### Option 4: "MacGyver" Retrofit (NOT RECOMMENDED)
**Force-fit modern system with heavy sealing**

**What DIYers Try**:
- Schluter tray with silicone seal only
- KBRS with trimmed flange
- Liquid waterproofing as only barrier

**Why It Fails**:
- No redundant waterproofing
- Silicone degrades over time
- Movement creates gaps
- No warranty coverage
- High leak probability

## KERDI-BAND Only Retrofit Method (NEW)

### Economical Schluter Retrofit Solution
For retrofits with 5-6" wall removal, KERDI-BAND alone provides sufficient waterproofing:

**Materials Needed**:
- 1 roll KERDI-BAND 7.25" x 33' (~$40)
- 2-4 KERDI-KERECK-F inside corners (~$8 each)
- Unmodified thin-set
- Schluter tray

**Installation**:
```
Existing Wall
━━━━━━━━━━━━
    ↑ 5.25" coverage
KERDI-BAND (7.25" wide)
    ↓ 2" overlap
━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Pan Edge
```

**Why This Works**:
- KERDI-BAND is the same material as KERDI membrane
- 2" overlap onto pan meets Schluter requirements
- 5.25" wall coverage exceeds minimum needs
- Saves ~$100 vs full membrane for small area

**Critical Details**:
- Must maintain 2" minimum overlap on pan
- Apply to clean, dust-free surfaces
- Use unmodified thin-set
- Press out all air bubbles
- Still use KERDI-KERECK at corners

## Recommended Approach

### For Your Specific Situation

Given that you're replacing a failed pan and willing to remove 5-6" of wall:

1. **Remove bottom 5-6"** of tile (minimum for proper install)
2. **Choose Schluter system** (best for retrofits)
3. **Use KERDI-BAND only** method (economical, effective)
4. **Add accent tile** or find matching tiles for the strip
5. **Document everything** for future reference

### Decision Tree
```
Can you find matching tiles?
├─ YES → Remove bottom rows, install properly
└─ NO → Consider:
    ├─ Decorative accent border
    ├─ Complementary tile pattern
    └─ Full shower renovation
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Partial Wall Removal + Proper Install
- **Cost**: $800-1,200 materials + tiles
- **Time**: 3-4 days
- **Risk**: Low
- **Longevity**: 20+ years

### Retrofit Workarounds
- **Cost**: $400-800 materials
- **Time**: 1-2 days
- **Risk**: High
- **Longevity**: 5-10 years (maybe)

### Full Shower Replacement
- **Cost**: $2,000-4,000 materials
- **Time**: 1-2 weeks
- **Risk**: Low
- **Longevity**: 25+ years

## The Bottom Line

**Professional Opinion**:
Don't try to save the bottom row of tiles. The risk of water damage from improper waterproofing far exceeds the cost of replacing some tiles. Water damage to subfloor and joists could cost $5,000-10,000 to repair.

**If you absolutely must keep walls intact**:
1. Use traditional mud bed method
2. Apply redundant sealants
3. Install moisture sensor below
4. Check frequently for leaks
5. Budget for potential repairs

## Important Warnings

### What Will Definitely Fail
- Silicone-only sealing at wall junction
- Any system without proper overlap
- Retrofit without addressing drainage plane

### Signs to Stop and Call a Pro
- Subfloor damage discovered
- Drain plumbing needs modification
- Structural concerns
- Matching tiles unavailable
- Local code requires permit
