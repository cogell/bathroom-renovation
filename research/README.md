## Research Documents

### Completed Research

#### [Electric Floor Heating Systems Comparison](electric-floor-heating-comparison.md)
**Status**: Brainstorming phase - NO DECISIONS MADE
- Evaluation of DITRA-HEAT-DUO vs. alternatives
- System performance analysis for specific project context (wood subfloor, basement access)
- Why "all-in-one" premium systems may not be optimal for this situation
- Cost vs. performance analysis
- Heat-up time research and factors
- **Key Finding**: Basement insulation may have more impact than system choice

#### [Subfloor Preparation Requirements](subfloor-preparation-requirements.md)
**Status**: Research complete, ready for assessment phase
- Comprehensive guide to subfloor requirements for tile + electric heating
- Material selection (plywood vs. OSB) with technical justification
- Thickness, flatness, and deflection specifications
- Joist spacing considerations for 1870 house
- Moisture management strategies
- "Universal subfloor" approach that works with any heating system
- Complete assessment checklist and replacement process
- Tools, materials, and cost estimates
- **Key Finding**: 3/4" exterior plywood eliminates subfloor as a decision variable

### In Progress Research
- [ ] **Basement insulation strategy** (NEXT PRIORITY)
  - Rockwool installation from below joists
  - R-value requirements
  - Installation methods
  - Impact on heating system performance

### Pending Research
- [ ] Tile selection and specifications
- [ ] Grout and sealant options
- [ ] Waterproofing membrane options
- [ ] Local building codes and permit requirements
- [ ] Tool requirements and rental vs. purchase decisions
- [ ] Layout planning for odd-shaped bathroom (6x6 minus 3x3 washer/dryer)

## Research Strategy

**Current Approach**: Research foundational elements (subfloor, insulation) before finalizing heating system choice. This ensures the system decision is based on actual performance and cost, not compatibility constraints.

**Decision Sequence**:
1. ‚úÖ Understand heating system options and performance factors
2. ‚úÖ Understand subfloor requirements (build "universal" subfloor)
3. ‚è≥ Research basement insulation (major performance impact)
4. üîú Assess actual subfloor condition
5. üîú Finalize heating system choice based on research
6. üîú Select tiles and complete specifications

**Status**: Active Research Phase
