## Research Documents

### Completed Research

#### [Electric Floor Heating Systems Comparison](electric-floor-heating-comparison.md)
**Status**: Brainstorming phase - NO DECISIONS MADE
- Evaluation of DITRA-HEAT-DUO vs. alternatives
- System performance analysis for specific project context (wood subfloor, basement access)
- Why "all-in-one" premium systems may not be optimal for this situation
- Cost vs. performance analysis
- Heat-up time research and factors
- **Key Finding**: Basement insulation may have more impact than system choice

#### [Subfloor Preparation Requirements](subfloor-preparation-requirements.md)
**Status**: Research complete, ready for assessment phase
- Comprehensive guide to subfloor requirements for tile + electric heating
- Material selection (plywood vs. OSB) with technical justification
- Thickness, flatness, and deflection specifications
- Joist spacing considerations for 1870 house
- Moisture management strategies
- "Universal subfloor" approach that works with any heating system
- Complete assessment checklist and replacement process
- Tools, materials, and cost estimates
- **Key Finding**: 3/4" exterior plywood eliminates subfloor as a decision variable

#### [Finish Floor Options Research](finish-floor/)
**Status**: Research complete, ready for decision
- Comprehensive analysis of 8 flooring options for bathroom with radiant heat
- Traditional tile (ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, glass)
- Modern alternatives: microcement, synthetic tadelakt, traditional tadelakt
- Resin-based coatings: epoxy and polyurethane systems
- Concrete systems: self-leveling, polished, stained
- Complete comparison matrix (cost, DIY difficulty, waterproofing, thermal performance)
- Detailed radiant heat compatibility protocols for each option
- Installation timelines and tool requirements
- **Key Finding**: Traditional tile (20-50yr lifespan) and microcement (seamless) are top DIY options at 5/10 difficulty

### In Progress Research
- [ ] **Basement insulation strategy** (NEXT PRIORITY)
  - Rockwool installation from below joists
  - R-value requirements
  - Installation methods
  - Impact on heating system performance

### Pending Research
- [ ] Final flooring selection based on budget and aesthetics
- [ ] Specific tile/finish specifications (if applicable)
- [ ] Grout and sealant selection (if tile chosen)
- [ ] Waterproofing membrane brand selection
- [ ] Local building codes and permit requirements
- [ ] Tool requirements and rental vs. purchase decisions
- [ ] Layout planning for odd-shaped bathroom (6x6 minus 3x3 washer/dryer)

## Research Strategy

**Current Approach**: Research foundational elements (subfloor, insulation, finish floor options) before finalizing specific product selections. This ensures decisions are based on actual performance, cost, and DIY feasibility, not just compatibility constraints.

**Decision Sequence**:
1. ‚úÖ Understand heating system options and performance factors
2. ‚úÖ Understand subfloor requirements (build "universal" subfloor)
3. ‚úÖ Research finish floor options (8 alternatives analyzed)
4. ‚è≥ Research basement insulation (major performance impact)
5. üîú Assess actual subfloor condition
6. üîú Finalize heating system choice based on research
7. üîú Select specific finish floor option and specifications

**Status**: Active Research Phase
