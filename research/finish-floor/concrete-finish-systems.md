# Concrete Finish Systems Research

## TL;DR
Concrete can be self-leveled, polished, overlaid, or stained to create durable flooring that works exceptionally well with radiant heat, but requires meticulous preparation and proper sealing for bathroom use.

## Summary
- **Self-leveling concrete** ($2-5/sq ft) creates smooth substrates over radiant heat but demands one-shot precision with 20-minute working windows (DIY difficulty: 6-7/10)
- **Polished concrete** ($10-15/sq ft) offers ultimate durability but requires expensive equipment ($200-300/day rental) and multiple grinding steps (DIY difficulty: 7-8/10)
- **Microtopping overlays** ($8-12/sq ft) provide thin decorative finishes at 1/16"-1/8" thickness with good heat compatibility (DIY difficulty: 5-6/10)
- **All concrete systems** require multiple sealer coats (penetrating + topical) for bathroom waterproofing and work excellently with radiant heating due to superior thermal mass
- **DIY-friendly option**: Stained concrete is most forgiving; polished concrete better left to professionals due to equipment costs and skill requirements

## Overview
Concrete finish systems encompass various methods of treating concrete surfaces to create durable, aesthetic flooring. These range from self-leveling overlays that serve as substrates to polished concrete that serves as the final wearing surface. These systems are particularly compatible with radiant heating due to concrete's excellent thermal mass properties.

## Self-Leveling Concrete/Underlayments

### Purpose and Function
Self-leveling concrete (SLC) is primarily used as a substrate to create a smooth, flat surface for finish flooring. However, with proper treatment, it can also serve as a finished floor.

### Types of Self-Leveling Products

- **Composition**: Gypsum, sand, polymers
- **Thickness**: 1/4" to 2"
- **Dry time**: 24-48 hours
- **Use**: Interior only, dry areas
- **Not suitable**: Direct bathroom floor finish

#### 2. Cement-Based Self-Levelers
- **Composition**: Portland cement, polymers, flow agents
- **Thickness**: 1/8" to 5"
- **Dry time**: 2-4 hours walkable
- **Use**: Interior/exterior, can handle moisture
- **Common brands**: Ardex, Mapei, Custom Building Products

#### 3. Hybrid/Modified Self-Levelers

### Application Process

#### Critical Preparation (Most Important Step)
1. **Perimeter Sealing**: THE MOST CRITICAL STEP
   - Use foam backer rod for large gaps
   - Apply expanding foam (gap/crack formula)
   - Caulk EVERYTHING multiple times
   - Check for any possible leak points
   - SLC will find ANY hole or gap

2. **Surface Preparation**
   - Clean thoroughly (no dust, oil, or debris)
   - Apply primer (specific to SLC brand)
   - Allow primer to dry to tacky stage

#### Mixing and Pouring

**Mixing Protocol**
