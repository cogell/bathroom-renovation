# Synthetic Tadelakt Systems Research

## TL;DR
Synthetic tadelakt delivers the luxury spa aesthetic of traditional Moroccan plaster but with modern waterproofing, zero monthly maintenance, and moderate DIY difficulty (5-6/10) at $15-25/sq ft materials—best for high-end seamless bathrooms without maintenance burden.

## Summary
- **Modern performance**: Resin-modified plasters provide inherent waterproofing without monthly soap treatments, handle all modern cleaners (bleach, acids), and resist stains/mold with zero special maintenance
- **Aesthetic luxury**: Seamless spa-like finish with full color spectrum, various sheen levels (matte to high gloss), and hand-troweled character—far superior appearance to painted or epoxy finishes
- **DIY accessible**: Moderate difficulty (5-6/10) with longer working time than traditional, mistakes can be sanded/recoated, standard trowels work, 24-72 hour cure vs. 2+ weeks for traditional
- **Premium pricing**: $15-25/sq ft materials, $40-60/sq ft professional install—more expensive upfront but 15-25 year lifespan with minimal maintenance justifies investment
- **Radiant heat friendly**: 2-3 day heat-off protocol (simple), flexible resins accommodate thermal expansion, maintains performance across temperature ranges unlike rigid traditional tadelakt
