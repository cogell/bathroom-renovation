## Research Context

### Project Specifics
- **Location**: Bathroom above basement (~36 sq ft total, ~27 sq ft heated)
- **House Age**: 1870 (with previous renovations)
- **Current Subfloor**: Unknown condition - possibly planks, possibly plywood with water damage
- **End Goal**: Tile floor with electric radiant heating
- **Approach**: DIY including subfloor repair/replacement

### Key Question
**"If I need to replace the subfloor, what should I install that will work with ANY electric heating system?"**

### Research Strategy
- Assume worst case: subfloor needs complete replacement
- Design "universal" subfloor that works with all heating system types
- Eliminate subfloor as a variable in heating system decision
- Meet or exceed all industry standards

---

## Why Subfloor Matters

### The Foundation of Everything
The subfloor is the foundation for:
1. **Tile installation** - Poor subfloor = cracked tiles
2. **Heating system** - Movement/deflection damages heating elements
3. **Long-term durability** - Fix it right once, never redo
4. **System choice flexibility** - Good subfloor works with all systems

### Common Subfloor Problems That Cause Tile Failure
- **Excessive deflection** - Floor bends under weight, cracks tile/grout
- **Movement** - Expansion/contraction cracks grout lines
- **Uneven surface** - High/low spots cause lippage, hollow spots
- **Moisture damage** - Rot, mold, structural weakness
- **Wrong material** - OSB under tile is problematic
- **Insufficient thickness** - Too thin = too much flex

### Cost of Getting It Wrong
- Tile replacement: $$$
- Heating system damage: $$$ (non-repairable once tiled over)
- Time lost: Weeks or months
- Doing it twice: Demoralizing and expensive

**Bottom Line**: Investing in proper subfloor is cheapest insurance policy.

## Material Choice: Plywood vs OSB

### Industry Consensus: Plywood for Tile Applications

**National Ceramic Tile Associations Position:**
- Discourage use of OSB as subfloor or underlayment below tile
- Primary concern: Edge swelling issues
- Recommendation: Plywood for tile installations

### Plywood Advantages

**Structural Benefits:**
- 10% stiffer than OSB (better deflection resistance)
- Better nail/screw holding power
- Dimensionally more stable
- Smooth surface ideal for adhesive bonding

**Moisture Performance:**
- Better moisture recovery characteristics
- If edges get wet and swell, they'll shrink back when dry
- Critical in bathroom environment
- Long-term durability in wet locations

**Tile-Specific Benefits:**
- Smooth face provides better thinset adhesion
- No edge swelling to telegraph through tile
- Better substrate for uncoupling membranes
- Approved by all tile and heating system manufacturers

### OSB Disadvantages for This Application

**Moisture Issues:**
- Edges swell when exposed to moisture
- **Edges stay swollen even after drying** (permanent deformation)
- Problematic in bathroom environment
- Risk with inevitable moisture exposure during construction

**Tile Industry Concerns:**
- Not recommended as bond surface for tile
- Can be used below other layers (e.g., under cement board)
- Edge swelling can cause tile failure
- Most tile warranties exclude OSB direct installation

**When OSB Might Be Okay:**
- As lower layer in double-layer system
- Under cement board (not direct tile contact)
- In very dry environments (not bathrooms)
- Where budget absolutely demands (not recommended)

### Plywood Specifications

**Type/Grade:**
- **Exterior-rated plywood** (CDX or better)
- "Exterior" refers to glue type, not intended use
- Moisture-resistant adhesive between plies
- Interior plywood uses weaker glue that fails when wet

**Common Grades:**
- **CDX**: C-grade face, D-grade back, Exterior glue (most common)
- **BCX**: Better face, good for visible applications
- **ACX**: Best face, premium (overkill for subfloor under tile)
- **OSB**: NOT recommended (included for comparison)

**What the Grades Mean:**
- A = Smooth, paintable face
- B = Solid surface, minor defects
- C = Some knots and defects (fine for subfloor)
- D = Larger defects allowed (back side is fine)
- X = Exterior glue (required for bathrooms)

**Typical Cost (2025):**
- 3/4" CDX plywood: $50-70 per 4x8 sheet (32 sq ft)
- 5/8" CDX plywood: $40-60 per sheet
- 3/4" OSB: $30-45 per sheet (cheaper but not recommended)

### Recommendation
**Use 3/4" exterior-rated CDX plywood for bathroom subfloor under tile with heating.**

## Thickness Requirements

### Industry Standards

**Minimum Acceptable:**
- 5/8" (19/32") plywood - Will work but minimum
- Meets basic structural requirements
- Common in production housing

**Recommended:**
- **3/4" (23/32") plywood** - Industry best practice
- Provides substantial stiffness increase
- "Solid feeling" floor
- Better long-term performance

**Performance Comparison:**
- 3/4" plywood is **almost 80% stiffer** than 5/8"
- Significant deflection improvement
- Better vibration damping
- Reduced squeaks and movement

### Thickness and Joist Spacing Relationship

**With 16" On-Center (OC) Joists:**
- 3/4" plywood: Excellent (recommended)
- 5/8" plywood: Acceptable minimum
- 1/2" plywood: Insufficient (too much deflection)

**With 19.2" OC Joists:**
- 3/4" plywood: Recommended
- 23/32" plywood: Even better
- 5/8" plywood: Marginal (may not meet deflection specs)

**With 24" OC Joists:**
- 3/4" plywood: Minimum, may need double layer
- Consider additional 3/8" underlayment layer
- Or use thicker single layer (1" plywood)
- Tile over 24" OC is challenging

### Why 3/4" is the Sweet Spot

**Engineering Benefits:**
- Meets/exceeds all deflection requirements at 16" OC
- Substantial stiffness for tile support
- Allows for proper screw/nail penetration
- Handles point loads (people standing)

**Practical Benefits:**
- Standard readily-available size
- Good cost-to-performance ratio
- Works with all heating systems without additional layers
- Professional installers typically use 3/4"

**Future-Proofing:**
- Accommodates heavy tile (natural stone)
- Supports any heating system choice
- Adequate for large format tiles
- Won't need reinforcement later

### Double-Layer Systems

**When You Might Need Two Layers:**
- Existing joists are 24" OC
- Existing subfloor cannot be removed
- Need to add height for transitions
- Maximum stiffness required (natural stone)

**Typical Configuration:**
- Existing: 5/8" subfloor
- Add: 3/8" or 1/2" underlayment
- Total: 1" to 1-1/8" combined
- Stagger seams between layers

**Our Recommendation:**
**Install single layer of 3/4" plywood if replacing subfloor completely.**

## Flatness & Deflection Specifications

### Flatness Requirements (Critical for Tile)

**Industry Standards (ANSI/TCNA):**

**For Standard Tiles (all sides under 15"):**
- Maximum variation: **1/4" in 10 feet**
- Maximum variation: **1/16" in 12 inches** (from high points)

**For Large Format Tiles (one side 15" or longer):**
- Maximum variation: **1/8" in 10 feet**
- Maximum variation: **1/16" in 24 inches** (from high points)

**What This Means Practically:**
- Use 8-10 foot straightedge to check floor
- Gaps under straightedge cannot exceed specifications
- High spots must be ground down
- Low spots must be filled with floor patch compound
- **This is non-negotiable** - out-of-flat floor = tile failure

**Electric Heating Consideration:**
- Flat subfloor ensures even heating cable/mat coverage
- Prevents hot spots from cables too close to tile surface
- Ensures proper thinset/mortar coverage
- Critical for system longevity

### Deflection Requirements (Structural)

**Traditional Minimum:**
- **L/360** before tile installation
- L = span (distance between joist supports)
- Floor shouldn't deflect more than span ÷ 360
- Example: 16" span ÷ 360 = 0.044" max deflection

**Reality for Tile:**
- L/360 is MINIMUM, not ideal
- Tile failures documented at L/600 (stiffer than L/360)
- Natural stone requires L/480 to L/720
- Stiffer = better for tile longevity

**What Causes Deflection:**
- Inadequate joist size/spacing
- Insufficient subfloor thickness
- Long joist spans
- Lack of blocking between joists
- Weak or damaged joists

**How to Improve Deflection:**
1. Closer joist spacing (16" better than 24")
2. Thicker subfloor (3/4" better than 5/8")
3. Joist blocking/bridging
4. Sister weak joists
5. Additional support beam (extreme cases)

**Heated Floor Specific:**
- Heating systems don't add significant weight
- BUT: Movement from deflection can damage heating elements
- Uncoupling membranes help (DITRA, etc.)
- Better to solve deflection at subfloor level

### Testing for Deflection

**Simple Field Test:**
1. Stand in center of bathroom
2. Have someone else watch floor nearby
3. Shift weight, walk around
4. Visible floor movement = too much deflection
5. If you can see it move, it's too much

**More Precise Testing:**
- Laser level across room
- Dial indicator measurement
- Professional deflection testing
- But usually: if it feels solid, it probably is

### Why This Matters for Heated Floors

**Tile Cracking:**
- Excessive deflection cracks tiles
- Cracks grout lines
- Compromises waterproofing

**Heating System Damage:**
- Flexing can damage heating cables
- Breaks embedded wires
- Creates hot spots
- **Cannot be repaired without removing tile**

**Sound and Feel:**
- Bouncy floor feels cheap
- Squeaks and creaks
- Not confidence-inspiring for expensive tile work

## Joist Spacing Considerations

### Why Joist Spacing Matters

Joist spacing determines:
- Required subfloor thickness
- Deflection characteristics
- Heating system compatibility
- Whether additional layers needed

### Common Joist Spacings

**16" On-Center (Most Common Modern, Good Old Houses):**
- Ideal for tile applications
- 3/4" plywood works perfectly
- All heating systems compatible
- No additional layers needed
- Meets all deflection requirements

**19.2" On-Center (Some Modern Construction):**
- Acceptable for tile
- 3/4" plywood recommended (not 5/8")
- Most heating systems work fine
- DITRA products approved up to 19.2" OC
- Verify specific system requirements

**24" On-Center (Some Old Houses, Budget Construction):**
- Problematic for tile
- Requires careful planning
- Options:
  - Add 3/8" underlayment over 3/4" subfloor
  - Use DITRA-XL (rated for 24" OC)
  - Sister joists to create 12" OC
  - Add midspan blocking
- Natural stone tile = serious concerns

**Irregular Spacing (1870s Houses):**
- Common in old construction
- May vary within same room
- Requires field measurement
- Plan for worst-case spacing
- May need blocking or additional support

### 1870 House Specific Considerations

**What to Expect:**
- Original framing likely 16" or wider
- May not be consistently spaced
- Actual lumber dimensions (full 2x8, not modern 1.5x7.25)
- Hand-hewn or rough-sawn lumber
- Possible previous modifications

**What to Check:**
- Measure spacing in multiple locations
- Identify pattern (if any)
- Note irregularities
- Check for notching or boring (weakens joists)
- Verify joist condition (rot, damage, insects)

**Joist Material:**
- Likely old-growth lumber (very dense, strong)
- May be stronger than modern lumber despite age
- Check for decay or insect damage
- Look for water staining

### Heating System Compatibility by Joist Spacing

**DITRA-HEAT / DITRA-DUO:**
- Approved: Up to 19.2" OC with standard DITRA
- Approved: Up to 24" OC with DITRA-XL
- At 24" OC: Must add 3/8" plywood over existing subfloor

**Loose Cable Systems:**
- Follow same rules as tile (16" OC ideal)
- Usually installed over cement board or membrane
- Cement board or membrane adds stiffness

**Mat Systems:**
- Same as loose cables
- No special joist requirements
- Follow tile industry standards

### Blocking Between Joists

**What is Blocking:**
- Short pieces of lumber between joists
- Prevents joist twisting
- Reduces floor bounce
- Improves overall stiffness

**When to Add Blocking:**
- Joists over 8 feet long
- Noticeable floor bounce
- Wide joist spacing (19.2" or 24")
- Tile installation over questionable structure

**Installation:**
- Use same size lumber as joists (e.g., 2x8)
- Stagger blocking for easier installation
- Nail through joist into blocking ends
- Install at mid-span between supports

### Assessment Priority

**Measure First, Plan Second:**
1. Remove existing flooring
2. Expose joists
3. Measure actual spacing in 3-4 locations
4. Identify any irregularities
5. Document joist size and condition
6. Then determine subfloor strategy

## Installation Best Practices

### Layout Strategy

**Orientation:**
- **Perpendicular to joists** (standard method)
- Strongest configuration
- Spreads load across multiple joists
- Industry best practice

**Alternative (if existing diagonal planks):**
- May want plywood parallel to joists
- Perpendicular to old plank direction
- Provides cross-bracing effect
- Check with building inspector if concerned

### Sheet Layout

**Stagger the Joints:**
- Offset seams between adjacent sheets
- Don't align joints in straight line across room
- Creates stronger overall floor
- Distributes loads better

**Plan for Minimal Waste:**
- 4x8 sheet = 32 sq ft
- Your ~36 sq ft bathroom = 2 sheets (with waste)
- Plan cuts to minimize waste
- Save cutoffs for other projects

**Support All Edges:**
- All plywood edges should land on joist or blocking
- OR use tongue-and-groove plywood (edges self-supporting)
- Unsupported edges = squeaks and movement
- Add blocking where needed

### Fastening

**Screws vs Nails:**
- **Screws recommended** (better holding power, won't pop)
- #8 or #10 coated deck screws
- 2" length (penetrates 1-1/4" into joist)
- OR ring-shank nails if nailing

**Fastening Pattern:**
- **8" spacing along edges** (along joists)
- **12" spacing in field** (middle of sheet)
- All fasteners into solid joist/blocking
- Don't overdrive (breaks plywood surface)
- Don't underdrive (proud heads interfere with tile)

**Pilot Holes:**
- Not required for most plywood
- May help near edges (prevents splitting)
- Helps with hardwood joists in old houses

### Expansion Gaps

**Between Sheets:**
- Leave **1/8" gap** between plywood sheets
- Allows for expansion/contraction
- Wood moves with humidity/temperature
- Use spacers during installation (8d nails work)

**At Perimeter:**
- Leave **1/4" gap** at walls
- Covered by baseboard/trim
- Prevents buckling if floor expands
- Standard practice

**Why Gaps Matter:**
- Plywood expands when humid
- No gap = buckling and squeaks
- Gap is insurance against seasonal movement
- Uncoupling membrane/thinset will bridge gap

### Subfloor Adhesive

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Construction adhesive between plywood and joists
- Reduces squeaks significantly
- Improves stiffness
- Creates stiffer composite structure

**Application:**
- Continuous bead on each joist
- Apply right before setting plywood
- Screw through adhesive before it skins over
- Cleans up with mineral spirits

**Product:**
- PL Premium or similar
- Subfloor-specific adhesive
- Not required but worth it

### Seam Treatment

**For Tile Installation:**
- Plywood seams don't need taping if:
  - Uncoupling membrane used (DITRA, etc.)
  - Cement board used
- Both systems bridge minor gaps

**If Installing Direct to Plywood:**
- Not recommended for this project
- Would need mesh tape and thinset over seams
- Better to use membrane or cement board

### Cutting and Fitting

**Around Fixtures:**
- Toilet flange: Cut hole precisely
- Vanity: Cut to fit (will be under cabinet)
- Pipes: Use jigsaw for notching
- Test fit before final installation

**Cutting Tools:**
- Circular saw for straight cuts
- Jigsaw for curves and notches
- Score and snap for minor adjustments (not plywood)
- Table saw for ripping (if available)

**Safety:**
- Eye protection (required)
- Dust mask (plywood dust)
- Hearing protection (power saws)
- Work gloves (handling sheets)

## Moisture Management

### Understanding the Environment

**Bathroom Above Basement:**
- Moisture from above (shower, bath, sinks)
- Potential moisture from below (basement humidity)
- Need to manage both directions
- Different concerns than slab-on-grade

### Vapor Barriers vs Moisture Barriers

**Definitions:**
- **Vapor barrier**: Blocks water vapor (gas)
- **Moisture barrier**: Blocks liquid water
- Often confused but different purposes

**Typical Materials:**
- Vapor barrier: 6-mil polyethylene sheeting
- Moisture barrier: Building paper, felt paper, house wrap
- Some products do both

### Moisture Testing (Do This First!)

**Simple Plastic Sheet Test:**

**Method:**
1. Tape 2x2 foot plastic sheet to basement ceiling below bathroom
2. Seal all edges with duct tape
3. Wait 24-48 hours
4. Inspect:
   - Condensation on top (joist side) = moisture from above
   - Condensation on bottom = moisture from basement air
   - No condensation = dry (ideal!)

**Interpretation:**
- Wet from above: Fix bathroom moisture source first
- Wet from below: Basement humidity issue
- Determines vapor barrier strategy

**Why This Matters:**
- Tells you direction of moisture movement
- Determines where vapor barrier goes (if needed)
- May reveal problems needing attention first

### Vapor Barrier Strategy

**Traditional Approach:**
- Vapor barrier on "warm side" (heated side)
- In heating climate: Under subfloor (bathroom side)
- Prevents warm moist air from condensing in cold joist bays

**Modern Thinking:**
- Depends on:
  - Basement conditioning (heated/unheated)
  - Local climate
  - Basement moisture levels
- May not need vapor barrier if basement is dry and conditioned

**Your Specific Situation:**
- Installing rockwool insulation from below
- Question: Does insulation need facing?
- Answer depends on testing results

**Options:**

**Option 1: No Vapor Barrier (Dry Basement)**
- If basement is dry and conditioned
- Rockwool is breathable
- Allows drying in both directions
- Simplest approach

**Option 2: Below Subfloor (Traditional)**
- 6-mil poly on top of joists
- Under new plywood subfloor
- Prevents moisture into joist bays
- Standard cold-climate approach

**Option 3: Faced Insulation**
- Rockwool with facing toward warm side
- Acts as vapor retarder
- Easier than separate poly sheet
- May cost more

### Waterproofing at Tile Level (Separate Issue)

**Bathroom Waterproofing Required:**
- Separate from subfloor vapor control
- Prevents water damage to subfloor/joists
- Critical in wet areas (tub/shower)
- Important even in "dry" bathroom areas

**Waterproofing Options:**

**Integrated (DITRA-HEAT):**
- Membrane itself is waterproof
- Protects subfloor from water penetration
- Requires proper sealing at edges/seams
- Schluter system includes all components

**Separate Membrane:**
- Redguard (liquid)
- Schluter KERDI (sheet)
- Aquadefense (liquid)
- Custom products
- Applied after subfloor, before tile

**Under Cement Board:**
- Cement board is NOT waterproof (lets water through)
- Need separate waterproofing
- Liquid membrane over cement board
- Or use sheet membrane

**Recommendation for This Project:**
- Proper subfloor vapor control (based on testing)
- PLUS waterproofing membrane under tile
- Two separate systems, different purposes

### Moisture in Old Houses

**1870 House Considerations:**
- May not have modern vapor barriers
- House "breathed" for 150 years
- Adding vapor barrier changes moisture dynamics
- Be thoughtful about changes

**Signs of Moisture Problems:**
- Current water damage in subfloor
- Musty smell
- Visible mold/mildew
- Rust stains
- Wood rot

**Before Adding Barriers:**
- Identify and fix sources
- Leaky plumbing
- Poor bathroom ventilation
- Basement moisture infiltration
- Condensation issues

- ✓ Check condition (no rot, solid structure)
- ✓ Sister weak joists if needed
- ✓ Add blocking between joists (recommended)
- ✓ Ensure proper support and stiffness

**Layer 2: Moisture Control (As Needed Based on Testing)**
- ✓ Perform plastic sheet test
- ✓ Install vapor barrier if indicated
- ✓ OR use building paper as moisture barrier
- ✓ OR skip if basement is dry and conditioned
- ✓ Document decision and reasoning

**Layer 3: Subfloor (3/4" Exterior Plywood)**
- ✓ 3/4" thick (23/32" actual)
- ✓ Exterior-rated CDX or better
- ✓ Perpendicular to joists
- ✓ Staggered joints
- ✓ 1/8" gaps between sheets
- ✓ 1/4" gap at perimeter
- ✓ Screwed every 8" on edges, 12" in field
- ✓ Optional: Construction adhesive on joists

**Layer 4: Flatten and Level (Critical Step)**
- ✓ Check flatness with 10' straightedge
- ✓ Identify high spots (grind or sand down)
- ✓ Identify low spots (fill with floor patch)
- ✓ Goal: 1/4" in 10' for standard tile
- ✓ Goal: 1/8" in 10' for large format tile
- ✓ Don't skip this step!

- **Tile selection** (impacts weight, heat-up time)
- **Moisture/waterproofing products** (for tile layer)

### Decision Tree

```
START: Assess existing subfloor
    │
    ├── Subfloor OK (minor issues)
    │   ├── Repair damaged sections
    │   ├── Flatten and level
    │   └── Proceed to heating system
    │
    └── Subfloor needs replacement
        ├── Assess joist condition
        │   ├── Joists OK → Replace subfloor only
        │   └── Joists damaged → Repair/sister joists + replace subfloor
        │
        ├── Perform moisture testing
        │   ├── Dry → No vapor barrier
        │   └── Wet → Install vapor barrier
        │
        ├── Install 3/4" plywood subfloor
        ├── Flatten and level to specs
        └── Proceed to heating system installation
```
