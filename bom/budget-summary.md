## Budget Notes

- **DIY Project**: All labor will be performed by homeowner
- **Contingency**: Buffer set at 10% of materials subtotal
- **Tool Costs**: Track separately as one-time investment (may be useful for future projects)
- **Labor Costs**: Professional installation quotes included for reference only (to quantify DIY savings)
- Update actual costs as purchases are made
- Track variance to identify budget overruns early

## Cost Tracking Guidelines

### Materials vs. Tools vs. Labor
- **Materials**: Consumable items used in the project (tile, grout, heating system, etc.)
- **Tools (Purchase)**: One-time purchases that will be kept (tile cutter, trowels, etc.)
- **Tools (Rental)**: Rented equipment (wet saw, etc.)
- **Labor**: Professional installation cost estimates (reference only, NOT part of project budget)

### DIY Savings Calculation
Total DIY Savings = (Materials + Professional Labor) - (Materials + DIY Tools + DIY Time)

Where DIY Time is valued at your opportunity cost (optional to calculate)
