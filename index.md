# Bathroom Renovation Project

## Project Overview

This project documents a complete DIY bathroom renovation in an 1870 house, focusing on replacing existing laminate flooring with an electric heated floor system and tile installation. All work will be performed by the homeowner, with comprehensive research and planning to ensure a successful outcome.

## Project Specifics

- **Location**: Small bathroom above basement (~36 sq ft total, ~27 sq ft heated area)
- **House Age**: 1870 (with previous renovations)
- **Approach**: 100% DIY including subfloor assessment/repair
- **Scope**: Remove laminate, repair/replace subfloor, install electric heating, install tile

## Project Goals

- Assess and repair/replace subfloor as needed
- Install basement insulation from below (rockwool)
- Install electric floor heating system (researching options)
- Install tile flooring over heated system
- Document the entire process for future DIY reference

## Documentation Sections

### [Research](research/)
Background research on materials, methods, and best practices for electric floor heating and tile installation. This section contains comprehensive findings on heating systems, waterproofing, finish floor options, and installation requirements.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Planning & Research - Exploring Options

### Recent Research Completed
- Electric floor heating systems comparison (no decisions made yet)
- Subfloor preparation requirements and specifications
- Finish floor options research (8 alternatives: tile, microcement, tadelakt, epoxy, polyurethane, concrete systems)
- Radiant heat compatibility protocols for all flooring types
- DIY feasibility analysis and cost comparisons

### Next Steps
- Basement insulation research (rockwool installation)
- Subfloor condition assessment (requires removing existing flooring)
- Final flooring selection (tile vs. microcement vs. alternatives)
- Final heating system selection after completing research
